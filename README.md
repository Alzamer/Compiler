# Compiler
~~C compiler made in Rust~~
Initially I planned to help myself with tools like lex/bison, but I will try
to code everything on my own.

## Update
When I learnt a little bit more about compilers I realised my initial idea is:
- time-consuming
- complex
- hard (optimizations on every phase etc.)

So I decided to make a compiler (toy-compiler more accurately) of a subset of C, which consists of:
- **char**,** int**, **void**,** for**,** if**, **else**, **struct**, **return**
- **#define** and **#undef**
- **functions** and **structs**
